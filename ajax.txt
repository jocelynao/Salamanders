ajax - can send a request by itself to a server
where the http request object is attached a callback function (javascript function that you usually create first)
create an https request object that contains the url that you want to send to the server 

after sending the request, the javascript code just continues
when web server automatically responds, the callback function automatically goes to the function and goes back the event hat triggered it

usually there's a div function to get data from server and place it into an innerhtml 

set up ajax call where it connects to a server 
set up webpage somewhere make an ajx request to get the text on that page and put it on your page
